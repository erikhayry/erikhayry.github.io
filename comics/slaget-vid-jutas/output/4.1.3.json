    "en": "Russian troops appear on the far side of the open field, partially obscured by smoke and rising mist. An officer in a dark green coat stands forward, shouting orders with a raised sword. Composition emphasizes contrast between cold blue-grey Russian ranks and the warmer tones of the Finnish side. DC Comics realism with dynamic light cutting through smoke."
