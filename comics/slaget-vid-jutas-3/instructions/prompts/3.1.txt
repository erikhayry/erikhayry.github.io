Style:
Use style from current-style.json with full aiInstructions from comic-styles.json.

Weather & Lighting:
Late-summer Finland. Soft afternoon light. Light showers earlier created
mud patches and darker soil. Mild breeze — grass and birch leaves moving subtly.
Smoke drifts horizontally (storyboard weather rules).

ActionSquare:

Ensure the ActionSquare remains readable even in wide composition.

Camera / Composition:
High, slightly angled wide shot. Deep perspective along the muddy road.
Foreground soldiers larger; background fades into mist.

No-Gutter / No-Margins Rule:
