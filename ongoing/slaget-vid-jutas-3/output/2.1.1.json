  "info": "Layout: Hero (single full-panel). ActionSquare centered on the two commanders; primary focus must be Döbeln (left) and Nikolaj Kamenskij (right) in medium-close portrait framing. Place both armies as background masses (low-detail silhouettes) to convey scale but keep foreground figures sharply rendered. Follow character visual identity and uniform rules from main-characters.json and soldier.json (Döbeln: Swedish officer — dark blue tunic, yellow facings, correct shako detailing; Kamenskij: Russian officer in dark green with red facings). Canvas size and no-gutter rules per page-layout.json Hero spec. This replaces the existing Page 2 Panel 1 entry in storyboard.json. No text or speech balloons in the image."
