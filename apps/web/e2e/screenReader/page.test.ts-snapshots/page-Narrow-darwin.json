  "image, A deserted country road near Jutas in a vertical composition, stretching from the foreground toward the distant horizon. The road winds gently through open late-summer fields with low grasses, wildflowers, and sparse shrubs. Soft daylight and a calm sky emphasize silence and emptiness, with no people, animals, buildings, or signs of conflict visible.",
